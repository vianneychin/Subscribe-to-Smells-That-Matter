## Why Full-stack?
Thus far, our React apps have been static, front-end only apps.
It's possible for static front-end only SPAs to have lots of functionality if they incorporate calls to **third-party** APIs.
However, it's more common for a SPA to be architected to include a back-end server app for tasks such as:
- Performing CRUD
- Authenticating users
Such an app, where we code the front-end and the back-end, as you know, is a full-stack application.
## Architecting a Full-stack App
Up until this point, we've taken for granted that full-stack apps, like your Express and Rails projects, we're a single, integrated project.
However, you've now seen that developing a React application is more complex due to the fact that it involves tooling, a development server, etc.
It get's even more complex when you want to serve your React app from a web application, like the Express apps you coded last unit, and want have the React SPA be able to make AJAX calls to the server - in both **development and production** environments.
#### Development Environment Complications
If we're going to develop using the MERN-stack, we have to figure out how we're going to:
- Use React's Development Server (`npm start`)
- **and**, run `nodemon` to productively develop the Express back-end
<details>
<summary>Why? There's a conflict, what is it?</summary>
They both run on port 3000 by default.
</details>
#### Production Environment Complications
To be able to deploy our MERN-stack app, we're going to have to:
- **Build** the React front-end code to make it production ready
- Configure the Express app to serve that production code
#### Possible Architectures
There are two general architectures we could pursue:
1. Maintain **two** separate projects, one for the React SPA, the other for the Express back-end.
1. Integrate the codebase for both the React front-end and the Express back-end.
| Architecture | Pros | Cons |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Separate Projects | Easier to set up. | Manage two projects and git repos. Must deploy to two separate hosts, **or**, copy over the front-end production code to the server project before each deployment. |
| Single Project | A single codebase. | More difficult to set up and configure. |
Me likey the single, integrated project approach, however, what does the structure of a single project look like?
Again, two options:
1. Start with an Express app, then generate the React app within it (naming it `client` or something similar). This approach will have nested **package.json** files and **node_modules** folders requiring you to "know where you are" when installing additional Node modules.
1. Start with a React app, then add an Express **server.js** and other server folders/files "around" it. This approach results in a single **package.json** file and **node_modules** folder.
Since we're going to continue to work with the Mastermind game app, we'll go with the second approach...
## Ready the Starter Code
The starter code is the React Mastermind app that includes the timer and practice exercises implemented from the previous lesson.
#### Setup
Ensure the starter code is ready:
1. `cd` to  the project folder in Terminal
2. Install the Node modules: `$ npm install`
3. Open your text editor
## Build the React App's Production Code
The server does not care about the code in the **React project**. The `src` and `public` folders within the React project are for development purposes only, not production. 
The Express server needs to be configured to serve the React app's **production** code - but we don't have production code, yet...
The `create-react-app` CLI has a build utility and a **build** script in **package.json**. Let's run it:
`$ npm run build`
> Note: npm requires us to use the `run` command for scripts other than `start`.
 
Examining our project's structure reveals a new **build** folder containing a production ready **index.html**, along with **css** & **js** folders.
Take a look at those production ready files just ready to be served up by an Express back-end...
## Code the Express App
We're going code our own Express app from scratch. This will be easier than using `express-generator` since we're starting with a fully-built React app and want to build a server app "around" it within the same project.
#### Install the Modules for the Express Server
The full-stack architecture we decided on uses a single **package.json** file (the one that was created by `create-react-app`).
What's cool is that the backend Express server can share that **package.json** with the React front-end.
For now, we're only going to install a minimal number of modules for the Express app:
`$ npm i express morgan serve-favicon`
> Note: We don't need a view engine because our server will be either serving static assets (index.html & CSS and JS files) or responding to AJAX requests with JSON. There will not be any *.ejs templates rendered.
In the future, to add additional features such as database access, we would install additional modules like `mongoose`, `body-parser`, `dotenv`, etc..
#### Create `server.js`
Let's write our server:
1. `$ touch server.js`.
2. At the top of **server.js**, let's do all the familiar stuff: `require` the modules, create the Express app and mount the `morgan` logging middleware:
    ```js
    var express = require('express');
    var path = require('path');
    var favicon = require('serve-favicon');
    var logger = require('morgan');
    
    var app = express();
    
    app.use(logger('dev'));
    ```
3. Mount the `serve-favicon` & `static` middleware so that they serve from the **build** folder:
    ```js
    // Configure both serve-favicon & static middlewares
    // to serve from the production 'build' folder
    app.use(favicon(path.join(__dirname, 'build', 'favicon.ico')));
    app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'build')));
    ```
4. A single "catch all" route is required for client-side routing to work properly:
    ```js
    // Put API routes here, before the "catch all" route
    
    // The following "catch all" route is necessary for
    // a SPA's client-side routing to properly work
    app.get('/*', function(req, res) {
      res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, 'build', 'index.html'));
    });
    ```
    > Note: Since this route is a "catch all" that matches every `get` request, be sure to mount API or other routes before it.
    
    The "catch all" route is necessary for when:
    - A user types a path into the address bar and presses enter.
    - A link is clicked in an external website, email, etc., that has its `href` set to our SPA's URL.
    For example, we slack the following link to a friend: `https://myapp.herokuapp.com/sales/dashboard`. The friend clicks on it, initiating an HTTP request to our server.
    
    Now, the `/sales/dashboard` part of the URL is supposed to be for the client router - not the server!  But there it is, and the server has to deal with it...
    
    The server deals with it by, thanks to the "catch all" route, sending back  **index.html** (after all, it's all we've got). When **index.html** loads in the browser, and our SPA's router kicks into action, it will see the `/sales/dashboard` and route to the correct feature, just as if the link was clicked from within the SPA.
5. Set the port for development to use 3001 so that React's dev server can continue to use 3000. Finally tell the Express app to listen for incoming requests:
    ```js
    // Configure to use port 3001 instead of 3000 during
    // development to avoid collision with React's dev server
    var port = process.env.PORT || 3001;
    
    app.listen(port, function() {
      console.log(`Express app running on port ${port}`)
    });
    ```
#### Try It Out
Again, React is using the **start** script, so be sure to start the Express app with `$ nodemon server.js`.
Now, because the server is running on `localhost:3001` (not port `3000`), that's where we need to browse to test out the full-stack SPA.
However, remember, the Express app serves the **production** version of our app - from the ____________ folder.
**What command must we run in Terminal to update the production code?**
## Configure React for Full-stack Development
So far, so good, but there will be a problem **during development** (not production)...
Because the React app is being served from `localhost:3000` during development, that's where all AJAX calls made from the browser to the server will go, however, our server is running on `localhost:3001`.
Luckily, the React team has created an easy fix for us. The React development server allows us to specify where API/AJAX calls with _relative paths_ should made.
The fix is to add a `"proxy"` key to **package.json**:
```js
...
  "scripts": {
    "start": "react-scripts start",
    "build": "react-scripts build",
    "test": "react-scripts test --env=jsdom",
    "eject": "react-scripts eject"
  },
  "proxy": "http://localhost:3001"
}
```
Now during development, the SPA can make AJAX calls to the server, such as `fetch('/api/todos)`, and they will be sent to `localhost:3001`.
Welcome to the MERN-stack!
## Essential Questions
- **What is the command that readies a React app for production?**
- **What folder holds a React app's production-ready code?**
- **What Express middleware needs to be configured to serve assets from the `build` folder?**
- **Why does a "catch all" route need to be mounted in Express?**
## Bonus - Deploying to Heroku
You want to play Mastermind on your phone or have friends play it, right? Get it deployed! 
Once the Express server has been tested, it's **almost** ready to be deployed to Heroku.
Heroku, if it does not have a **Procfile**, will look for a **start** script in **package.json**. Yes, we have a **start** script, but it's configured to start React's dev server - not our run **node server.js**.
The easy way out is to create that **Procfile**:
- `$ touch Procfile`
Then, adding a single line inside **Procfile** takes care of informing Heroku how to boot our app:
`web: node server.js`
One more change, React adds the **/build** folder to the **.gitignore** - we need to comment it out:
```
# production
#/build
```
Now you are set to deploy to Heroku. Don't forget that you deploy by pushing the `master` branch to the `heroku` remote (created with `heroku create`).
Play it anywhere!

## Lab
You enjoy challenges - you've come to the right place!
Now that we've taken Mastermind full-stack, what better way to get some practice using a back-end's API than to persist high-scores?
#### Hints:
- Plan what the UI should look like. Perhaps another client-side route and React "page" component makes sense.
- The back-end API will work no differently than what we've already built in class. Define API routes on the server, return JSON - you've seen this movie.  Remember to follow the best practice of name-spacing your API routes with `/api/`.
- What will the high-score schema/model look like? Keep it simple, the player's `initials`, `numGuesses` and `seconds` should work.
- Composing the query to return high-scores:  When determining high-scores, `numGuesses` should probably be prioritized over `seconds` - Mongoose's `sort` query method will help with this. Also, you probably only want to return the top 20 or so to the client to be rendered. You can chain the Mongoose `limit` query method to make this happen.
- When a player has won, that's the moment to check if the score made the list and, if so, get their initials and make the AJAX request to persist the score. FYI, the solution code took the easy way out and used a JS `prompt()` to ask the player for their initials. Feel free to improve upon this!
- Don't forget to install the necessary node modules like `dotenv`, `mongoose` & `body-parser`. You will **not** need `method-override` (you know why - right?).
- Also, you'll need a hosted MongoDB if you want to deploy. You already have an mLab account, so go for it.
#### Super Bonus
- If a score has made the list, how about letting the user know by moving to the high-score route! This requires that the `<App>` component be able to access `BrowserRouter`'s `history` object. However, this requires a refactor to ensure that:
    - `<App>` is nested within `BrowserRouter`
    - `<App>` is also wrapped by a `<Route>` component that has its `render` prop (vs. the simpler `component` prop) set to an arrow function that provides the `<Route>` props to `<App>` and returns `<App>` to be rendered. See `index.js` in the solution code for help. Note also the minor refactoring of routing within **App.jsx**. 
- Program the back-end to limit the number of high-scores in the collection to what you want. Adding a new high-score would require removing the worst score if the collection grows larger than the number of high-scores you want to keep.  This would be a good use case for Mongoose middleware on the high score schema.
